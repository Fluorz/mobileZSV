             <h2><strong>PRE-ENGINEERED BUILDINGS</strong></h2>
         <p><strong>Pre-Engineered Buildings (PEB) are “tailor made” steel buildings</strong> &nbsp;based on the architecture and engineering requirements of the users.</p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <h2><strong>What are Pre-Engineered Buildings ?</strong></h2>
         <p>Typically, a <strong>Pre-Engineered Buildings or PEB buildings</strong> is made of three distinctive parts:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Primary framing members (columns and rafters), which are tapered built-up sections, with large depths in areas of higher stress according to the Bending Moment Diagram</li>
             <li>Secondary structural members (roof purlins, eave struts, wall girts and others), which are light weight cold-formed “Z” and “C” shaped members</li>
             <li>Roll formed profiled sheeting (roof and wall panels)</li>
         </ul>
         <p>All the primary framing members and secondary structural members are pre-sheared, pre-punched, pre-drilled, pre-welded and pre-formed in the factory before being shipped to the job site for erection.</p>
         <p>The pre-fabricated components are then fixed and jointed via bolt and nut connections at job site.</p>

         <ul>
             <li><strong>Cost-effective</strong></li>
         </ul>
         <p>Saving material on low stress areas of the primary framing members makes <strong>Pre-Engineered Building</strong> more cost-effective than conventional <a href="http://zamilsteel.com.vn" data-aalisten="1">steel buildings</a></p>
         <ul>
             <li><strong>Quick Fabrication &amp; Installation </strong></li>
         </ul>
         <p><strong>Pre-Engineered Building systems</strong> focus on using pre-determined material stock and pre-designed connections to design and fabricate the building structures, thus significantly reducing the time required for design, fabrication and installation.</p>
         <ul>
             <li><strong>A versatile building system that fits various applications</strong></li>
         </ul>
