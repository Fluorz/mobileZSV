    'a_1' => 'The AISC, headquartered in Chicago, is a not-for-profit technical institute and trade association established in 1921 to serve the structural steel design community and construction industry in the United States and worldwide. AISC’s mission is to make structural steel the material of choice by being the leader in structural-steel-related technical and market-building activities, including specification and code development, research, education, technical assistance, quality certification, standardization, and market development.
With nearly 95 years serving the construction industry, AISC has set the standards for steel construction quality that U.S. steel building fabricators have striven to follow over the years.',
    'q_2' => 'What is the AISC’s Standard for Steel building structures & Sophisticated paint endorsement?',
    'a_2' => 'AISC’s Standard for Steel Building Structures is widely recognized among North American builders and contractors in assessing the fabricator’s capability to satisfy project quality needs. The standard includes all requirements for certification of the facilities that fabricate and supply structural steel frames for buildings and a quality management system with functions and responsibilities.
Structural steel fabricators must undergo an initial evaluation program, audited directly by AISC’s independent auditors, in order to be certified, and subject to yearly review. The audit scope includes all functions of structural steel fabrication, from the receipt of the contract until final delivery, excluding the erection process.
The Sophisticated Paint Endorsement (SPE) is a program included in the AISC’s Standard for Steel Building Structures Certification that inspects the fabricator’s painting facility for complex protective coating systems, such as zincs, epoxies, urethanes, and multi-coat systems.',
    'q_3' => 'What is an AISC certified fabricator?',
    'a_3' => 'An AISC-certified fabricator for steel building structures is automatically certified for conventional steel building structures. By meeting AISC’s Standard for Steel Building Structures, fabricators are confirmed by the AISC to have the facilities, personnel, organizational experience, procedures, knowledge, equipment, and commitment for structural steel building construction.
An AISC fabricator is often entrusted with large public service and institutional buildings, heavy manufacturing plants, powerhouses, metal producing/rolling buildings, stadiums, auditoriums, high-rise buildings, and chemical and petrochemical plants.',
